In this Repo, there is the Submission Jupyter Notebook File as well as the AI model used to make predictions on the dice.

This file runs within the Yahboom environment, and it is assumed the person who intends to make use of this also has access to the Yahboom environment.

As such, no pip installs are required, and it can just be used as is. It is important to drop the AI model into the *SAME ROOT DIRECTORY* so that it can be loaded and used.
